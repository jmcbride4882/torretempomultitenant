# packages/shared - Shared Types

**Generated:** 2026-01-28 21:43
**Commit:** 0255da4
**Branch:** main

## OVERVIEW
Shared TypeScript enums, interfaces, and constants consumed by web and API.

## STRUCTURE

```
shared/
├── src/index.ts
└── tsconfig.json
```

## WHERE TO LOOK

| Task | Location | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Add shared types | `src/index.ts` | Single entry point |
| Build output | `dist/` | Generated by tsc |

## CONVENTIONS
- Keep exports serializable (no runtime dependencies).
- Prefer enums/interfaces for shared domain shapes.
- Maintain backward compatibility for API payloads.

## ANTI-PATTERNS
- No imports from app-specific modules.
- No browser- or server-only globals.
- No side effects at module load.

## NOTES
- Build with `npm run build -w packages/shared`.
